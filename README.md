#Themety 

###My custom zsh theme

* Inspired by [afowler's](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/afowler.zsh-theme).
* Works best with `tomorrow-night` or `tomorrow-night-eighties` themes, you can get them [here](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme)

###Features:

* If in the `git` repository, it shows the current branch and whether its committed at the right-hand side 
* Shows cyan colons instead of the white ones when you're `ssh`'ing somewhere
* The arrows becomes red when you're root
